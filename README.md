# Flex Agent Addons Plugin

## Flex plugin

A Twilio Flex Plugin allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and how to use the API, check out our [Flex documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex).

## Features

### Custom directory

When in a call, a new "Directory" tab is added to the transfer panel to allow cold transfers (and optionally warm transfers) to custom defined contacts. Both warm and cold transfers from the directory are accomplished by calling Twilio Functions to perform the required Twilio API requests. The directory's contents are loaded via a directory JSON file. Here is an example file:

```
[
  {
    "id" : "1",
    "name": "Weather Phone",
    "phone": "+13172222222",
    "enableWarmTransfer": "true"
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "name": "Twilio",
    "phone": "+18448144627"
  },
  {
    "id": "3",
    "name": "My SIP Contact",
    "phone": "+18448144627",
    "sipTarget": "target1",
    "enableWarmTransfer": "true"
  }
]
```

The `enableWarmTransfer` property can be set on each contact to control whether warm transfers are allowed for that contact.

The `sipTarget` property can be set on contacts that are dialed via SIP. The `sipTarget` is used to select the list of SIP endpoints that should be used for this contact (see the SIP Failover section below).

### External transfer

When in a call, a "plus" icon is added to the Call Canvas where you can add a external number to the call. This action executes a Twilio Function that uses the Twilio API to make a call and add this call to the current conference. In the Flex UI side, the participant is added manually and both hold/unhold and hangup buttons are available.   

This feature is based on the work on this [project](https://github.com/twilio-labs/plugin-flex-outbound-dialpad).

### Hang up by

This feature writes to the `conversations.hang_up_by` task attribute to allow reporting within Flex Insights on which party ended a call. This is accomplished by adding various Flex UI action and event listeners to deduce the reason for the conversation ending.

For external transfers, this also writes the `conversations.destination` task attribute to allow reporting on the phone numbers customers are being transferred to.

The following values may be set for hang up by:
- Customer
- Agent
- Consult _(a consulting agent left the call before a warm transfer completed)_
- Cold Transfer
- Warm Transfer
- External Cold Transfer
- External Warm Transfer

### Hold time

This feature writes the `conversations.hold_time` task attribute to override the hold time calculated by Insights. This allows excluding [automatic hold times caused by warm transfers](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/end-user-guide/insights/metrics/hold-time#conversations-with-transfers-and-conferences), which cause misleading hold time reporting.

This feature is implemented using Twilio Sync, by creating a Sync Doc per reservation which tracks cumulative hold time for the reservation. Due to limits in place for concurrent Sync connections, no Sync client is included in this plugin. Instead, it relies on the Sync client in [the supervisor barge/coach addon](https://github.com/dremin/plugin-supervisor-barge-coach-ipc), using the Actions framework to transfer Sync data between the plugins. That plugin must be running for this functionality to work.

### Internal transfer add-ons

These features are documented [here](https://github.com/trogers-twilio/flex-internal-transfer-addons).

This solution provides the following enhancements / modifications to the Flex native internal transfer experience:

1. Removes the Agents tab in the transfer directory, so agents are not able to transfer directly to other agents
1. Hides a configurable list of Queues from the Queues tab of the transfer directory
1. Adds support for an Hours of Operations check on each queue. Displays a CLOSED message with hours of operation on each closed queue on the Queues tab of the transfer directory, and shows a closed notification with hours of operation if the agent tries transferring to a closed queue.
1. Sets the priority of a transferred task to the same priority used for new inbound tasks of the target transfer queue

#### Hidden Agent Tab in Transfer Directory

No configuration is required for this feature. The Agents tab is removed for all Flex users.

#### Hidden Queues in Transfer Directory

By default, the Flex UI will show all active TaskQueues in the Queues tab of the transfer directory. However, the Flex UI supports hiding Queues from the [WorkerDirectoryTabs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/components#workerdirectorytabs) by setting `Flex.WorkerDirectoryTabs.defaultProps.hiddenQueueFilter`.

This plugin looks for the list of queue names to hide in the [Flex Configuration](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/configuration#modifying-configuration-for-flextwiliocom) property `ui_attributes.internalTransferAddonsPlugin.hiddenTransferQueues`. Please follow the Twilio documentation for modifying the [Flex Configuration](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/configuration#modifying-configuration-for-flextwiliocom).

> NOTE: Queues names in the `hiddenTransferQueues` array are case sensitive. They must match the TaskQueue name exactly.

Here is an example config for this property:

```json
"internalTransferAddonsPlugin": {
  "hiddenTransferQueues": [
    "HiddenQueueName1",
    "HiddenQueueName2",
    "HiddenQueueName3"
  ]
}
```

#### Queue Hours of Operation 

The hours of operation and holidays are maintained in the `queue-hoops` asset file. Navigate to [`serverless/assets/queue-hoops.private.json`](/serverless/assets/queue-hoops.private.json) folder in this repository for an example of the configuration file structure.

##### Timezone

The first property is `timezone`. Set this to the timezone for the open and close hours. It will be converted to the Flex user's local timezone when evaluating if a queue is open or closed at the time of transfer. You can fine a list of timezone names in the Wikipedia article, [List of tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

##### Hours of Operation

Hours for all queues, regardless of name, can be set in the `global.global` property. Hours are defined for each day, using the three letter abbreviation for the day of week: `[Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun]`. Any days not included will be considered closed for the entire day.

Only full hours are supported, not half hours, and must be specified in 24 hour format. So a queue could open at 8:00am, but not 8:30am. And if it's closing at 5:00pm, the hour would be `17`.

For example, to set the open hours for all queues to `Mon to Fri, 8:00am to 5:00pm`, this would be the `global.global` config:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "global": {
      "Mon": {
        "open": 8,
        "close": 17
      },
      "Tue": {
        "open": 8,
        "close": 17
      },
      "Wed": {
        "open": 8,
        "close": 17
      },
      "Thu": {
        "open": 8,
        "close": 17
      },
      "Fri": {
        "open": 8,
        "close": 17
      },
    }
  }
}
```

To set the hours for a group of queues containing a key word or phrase, that word or phrase can be defined in the top level `global` property.

For example, if all queues with `Support` in the TaskQueue name are open from 5:00am to 9:00pm, this would be the config:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "global" {
      ...
    },
    "support": {
      "Mon": {
        "open": 5,
        "close": 21
      },
      "Tue": {
        "open": 5,
        "close": 21
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

Queues with `Support` anywhere in their TaskQueue name will match the `global.support` hours. All other queues will match the `global.global` hours.

Now let's say there a single Support queue named `Support Mobile` that has different hours from all other Support queues. This queue is open 24 hours. This is supported in the configuration by defining the first key word or phrase of the queue name at the top level, and the second key word or phrase within that top level property.

For example, here is how we would override the general `Support` hours only for the `Support Mobile` queue, which is open 24 hours:

```json 
{
  "global": {
    "global" {
      ...
    },
    "support": {
      "Mon": {
        "open": 5,
        "close": 21
      },
      "Tue": {
        "open": 5,
        "close": 21
      },
      ...
    }
  },
  "support": {
    "mobile": {
      "Mon": {
        "open": 0,
        "close": 24
      },
      "Tue": {
        "open": 0,
        "close": 24
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that we define 24 hours with an open hour of `0` and a close hour of `24`. This can be used for all queues that do not close at all on a particular day.

With the above config, any queues with `Support` and `Mobile` in their name will match the `support.mobile` hours. Any other queues with `Support` in their name will match the `global.support` hours. All other queues will match the hours in `global.global`.

##### Holidays
Days that queues are closed for a holiday or any other reason the normal hours should be ignored are defined in the `holidays` property under the appropriate matching queue name key.

Days are defined with the three letter month abbreviation and the numeric day of the month. The month abbreviations are `[Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec]`.

Continuing with the examples above, let's say that:

* All queues are closed December 25th, January 1st, and July 4th...
* ...except Support queues, which are only closed December 25th and January 1st...
* ...except Support Mobile queues, which are only closed December 25th

This is what that configuration would look like:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "global" {
      "holidays":[
        "Jan 1",
        "Jul 4",
        "Dec 25"
      ],
      "Mon": {
        "open": 8,
        "close": 17
      },
      "Tue": {
        "open": 8,
        "close": 17
      },
      ...
    },
    "support": {
      "holidays":[
        "Jan 1",
        "Dec 25"
      ],
      "Mon": {
        "open": 5,
        "close": 21
      },
      "Tue": {
        "open": 5,
        "close": 21
      },
      ...
    }
  },
  "support": {
    "mobile": {
      "holidays":[
        "Dec 25"
      ],
      "Mon": {
        "open": 0,
        "close": 24
      },
      "Tue": {
        "open": 0,
        "close": 24
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

#### Task Priority on Transfer

By default, when a task is transferred in Flex, the task priority is not changed. The challenge this creates is that if a task is being transferred to a queue where new tasks routed to that queue are given a higher priority than the transferred task, that transferred task will essentially get "stuck" behind all new tasks and will not route to an agent until there are no more higher priority tasks waiting in the queue.

This plugin feature avoids that scenario by setting the transferred task's priority to the highest priority used for new tasks entering the target queue. 

The new priority for the transferred task is determined by evaluating all TaskRouter Workflows, looking for routing steps referencing the target TaskQueue SID. The priority defined in the matching routing step is what's used for the transferred task.

If multiple routing steps are found referencing the target TaskQueue, the highest priority used in the matching routing steps is what's used for the transferred task.

If no routing steps are found referencing the target TaskQueue, the transferred task's priority is not changed.

> NOTE: This feature is only designed to work with task priorities controlled by Workflow routing steps. If task priorities are being set in other ways, such as at task creation, the plugin will not be aware of it and it may result in the "stuck" task scenario described above.

### SIP Failover

The custom directory feature supports transferring to SIP targets. When doing so, the `cold-transfer-sip` and `add-conference-participant-sip` functions are used to facilitate the transfer. These functions implement a failover mechanism in case a SIP endpoint is not available. The `sip-targets.json` asset contains ordered arrays of SIP targets to use. The array used is determined by the `sipTarget` parameter passed.

If all SIP targets fail, an error message will be played. For cold transfers, this error message is set in the `cold-transfer-sip-callback` function. For warm transfers, this error message is set in the `sip-failure.xml` asset.

# Configuration

## Flex Plugin

This repository is a Flex plugin with some other assets. The following describing how you setup, develop and deploy your Flex plugin.

### Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Afterwards, install the dependencies by running `npm install`:

```bash
cd 

# If you use npm
npm install
```

### Development

In order to develop locally, you can use the Twilio CLI to run the plugin locally. Using your commandline run the following from the root dirctory of the plugin.

```bash
twilio flex:plugins:start
```

This will automatically start up the Webpack Dev Server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

When you make changes to your code, the browser window will be automatically refreshed.


### Deploy

#### Plugin Deployment

Once you are happy with your plugin, you have to deploy then release the plugin for it to take affect on Twilio hosted Flex.

Run the following command to start the deployment:

```bash
twilio flex:plugins:deploy --major --changelog "Notes for this version" --description "Functionality of the plugin"
```

After your deployment runs you will receive instructions for releasing your plugin from the bash prompt. You can use this or skip this step and release your plugin from the Flex plugin dashboard here https://flex.twilio.com/admin/plugins

For more details on deploying your plugin, refer to the [deploying your plugin guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/plugins#deploying-your-plugin).

Note: Common packages like `React`, `ReactDOM`, `Redux` and `ReactRedux` are not bundled with the build because they are treated as external dependencies so the plugin will depend on Flex to provide them globally.

## Flex UI Configuration

Before running the plugin, [update your Flex configuration](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/configuration) `ui_attributes` object to include the following additional string properties:
- `domainName`: the domain of the serverless functions deployed as part of these instructions
- `directoryUrl`: the URL of the custom transfer directory JSON

## Twilio Serverless 

You will need the [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart) and the [serverless plugin](https://www.twilio.com/docs/labs/serverless-toolkit/getting-started) to deploy the functions inside the ```serverless``` folder of this project. You can install the necessary dependencies with the following commands:

`npm install twilio-cli -g`

and then

`twilio plugins:install @twilio-labs/plugin-serverless`

# How to use

1. Setup all dependencies above: Flex UI configuration and Twilio CLI packages.

2. Clone this repository

3. run `npm install`

4. copy `./serverless/.env.example` to `./serverless/.env` and populate the appropriate environment variables.

```
ACCOUNT_SID=
